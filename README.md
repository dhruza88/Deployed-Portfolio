# Deployed-Portfolio

In this assignment we were tasked from building an html website from the ground up. Being provided no starter code or no style sheet. I established the various differente elements of the website to give different sections to create the navbar, sidebar, and main contents.

This assignment forced me into understanding spacing, margin and various other css style elements to replicate the image that we were provided. Dealing with various different tasks as using an image as a background for a container box. Which in turn when clicking brings you to a hyperlink of a completed deployed project.

Testing my understanding of an adjustable screen also, so while using different devices, the outlook of the page isn't distorted because its not a traditional screen size.

Between text styling, boxshadow, aligning of elements, using the hover feature, this project incorporated of all the different CSS elements shown to us thus far, and even more that required some research and reading.

Key Note: Project 5 links to google as at the moment i only had 4 different projects uploaded onto github.
